weather-notifications
=====================

A program written in Python to send text messages every x hours notifying you about the weather in your chosen area. First python project I made on my own. 



Construct a Messages class. Then perform the class method send_text() and the object will use the proper methods to fetch weather reports etc. 


It's also controlled by time, so if time is < 9 AM, it won't run, or if time is > than 23:30, it wont run either.
