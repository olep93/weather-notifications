weather-notifications
=====================

A program written in Python to send text messages every x hours notifying you about the weather in your chosen area. First python project I made on my own. 

Construct a Messages class. Messages class takes one argument, self.number. The class is fully automated, all it requires is the usage of the class method send_text().

It's also controlled by time, so if time is < 9 AM, it won't run, or if time is > than 23:30, it wont run either.


Enjoy
