Problem/Idea definition:


It initially started with me running out of 4g on my phone, of course this would happen 
while painting my parents' house, and outside of WiFi range. 
Desperate to check the weather, I came up with an idea, that would make my life easier!

In summation:

My project idea was an app meant to be run on a server (daemon) that would webscrape 
a weather forecast website, query said site scrape out the degrees and
text them to me for free using Twilio.
It would also post the time and date, and only run at times of necessity 
(e.g between 10 AM and 11 PM.). So even when out of 4G, or 4G range, I would be able to check
the degrees, to have something to complain about!
