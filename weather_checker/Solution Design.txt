Solution Design:

 !!!For class Diagram please see the attached JPG named "Class Diagram"!!!

The program should:

1. Scrape temperatures from a set website (www.yr.no)
2. Add this string, + some other minor features like date, time and location 
and send it by text to my phone.
3. Make it only send at normal times, like between 9AM and 11.30PM


In order for step 1 to succeed, I had to read up on some common webscraping techniques.
I found beautifulsoup to satisfy my needs.

Step 2 required some regex(regular expressions) and some decoding due to the nature
of the Norwegian alphabet. This, however, was no big deal.

What really bugged me was the class methods didn't really have to be class methods, as they were
static. Until I found out all I had to do was tag them with @staticmethod.

3. This required some tinkering with time and datetime, as the class I needed from
datetime was also named time, which messed with the namespaces, as I needed 
time.sleep, and the time module and class has the same name.
